A user has completed an onboarding interview. Based on their answers, generate a highly personalized, detailed 3-level learning roadmap focusing EXCLUSIVELY on teaching the BASICS / FOUNDATIONS of the topic "${userTopic}" extremely well.

USER INTERVIEW:
${qa}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:
The generated roadmap MUST cover only the basic, fundamental aspects of "${userTopic}" in extreme, granular detail.
Do NOT include advanced topics like system architecture, complex scaling, advanced design patterns, or highly specialized production techniques. Focus on building a rock-solid, deep understanding of the basics.
Tailor the details (especially Level 3) to the user's specific reason for learning: "${userReason}" and their goals. For example, if their reason is a "job", include common entry-level interview questions and core concepts asked in tests. If it is for a "project", include practical foundations.

Generate a JSON roadmap with this EXACT structure:

  "topic": "short specific topic name (2-4 words)",
  "goal": "one sentence summarizing what they want to achieve",
  "summary": "2-3 sentences describing why this roadmap is tailored for them, focusing on mastering the basics for their goal",

        "searchQuery": "YouTube search query to find the best educational video or tutorial for this milestone",
        "keyPoints": ["point 1", "point 2", "point 3", "point 4"],

  }
}

Rules:
- Each of the three levels MUST contain EXACTLY 6 to 8 milestones (do not generate fewer than 6 milestones per level under any circumstances). A detailed and granular roadmap is required.
- Do not limit the roadmap to a high-level overview. Provide granular, distinct milestones for specific sub-topics. Split different foundational building blocks into separate, dedicated milestones to teach them really well.
- Level 1 milestone 0 must have status "unlocked", all others "locked"
- Milestones must be highly specific to the actual topic basics and goal — NOT generic templates
- searchQuery should return real, relevant YouTube search queries (e.g., "[topic] [milestone title] tutorial")
- keyPoints should be actionable and specific to the milestone sub-topic
- estimatedMinutes: 30-120 based on depth
- Be extremely detailed, practical, and tailored to the topic "${userTopic}"

# ${milestone.title}

## 🎯 What You'll Learn & Why It Matters
Explain the purpose of this milestone in depth. Why does it exist, what problem does it solve, and how does it fit into the broader topic? Relate it directly to the user's reason for learning: "${userReason}".

## 🔍 Core Concepts Explained
Provide an exhaustive breakdown of the sub-topics under this milestone.
Be extremely detailed. Explain the underlying rules, mechanics, and terminology. Use analogies if helpful. Do not summarize or gloss over edge cases. Teach this foundational aspect extremely well.

## 📋 Comparison Matrix
Include a clear Markdown table comparing key aspects, options, or dimensions of the sub-topics under this milestone (e.g., comparing different approaches, syntax, methods, tools, or concepts).

## 💻 Practical Demonstration & Examples
- If the topic is a programming language, framework, or software tool:
  Provide a clear "Common Pitfall / How NOT to do it" code block, followed by an explanation of the bug/error.
  Then show a "Best Practice / How to do it" code block with clean, modern code.
  Ensure code blocks are wrapped in standard triple-backticks specifying the correct language syntax (e.g., python, javascript, sql, bash, etc.).
- If the topic is non-technical (e.g., history, business, language, art):
  Provide a detailed "Common Misconception" section explaining a frequent error or incorrect belief, followed by an explanation of why it is incorrect.
  Then provide a "Best Practice / Correct Concept" section explaining the correct understanding or application.

## 💼 Core Interview Questions (Targeted for "${userReason}")
Identify 3-4 actual, high-quality questions related to this milestone (especially the tricky or fundamental ones that test deep understanding).
For each question, provide:
1. **The Question**
2. **The Ideal Answer** (what an expert or senior professional would say to impress the interviewer)
3. **Under-The-Hood Explanation** (the deep explanation of the mechanics/reasons behind the answer)

## ⚡ Interactive Practice & Exercises
Provide 2 small exercises, scenarios, or mental puzzles (with answers/explanations hidden under a "Spoiler" description or explanation below them) that the user can do to verify their understanding.

Ensure the tone is professional, encouraging, and highly educational. Generate the complete notes without placeholders.
Your word count and depth must dynamically adapt to the complexity of the milestone:
- For complex milestones (involving intricate rules, underlying architecture, or multi-step logic): Write a detailed, exhaustive study guide (800-1200 words) covering deep theory, edge cases, extensive examples, and detailed explanations.
- For simple or syntax-only milestones (straightforward definitions, basic terms, or simple conventions): Keep it concise and direct (400-600 words) with clear explanations and examples. Do NOT add unnecessary fluff or wordy explanations just to hit a high word count.`;

Your task is to generate a comprehensive quiz consisting of two parts based on the content of a YouTube video:
1. exactly 5 general multiple choice questions for the END of the video (postVideoQuestions).
2. exactly ${numInVideoQuestions} in-video pop quiz questions (inVideoQuestions), each testing details presented in the corresponding segment transcript below.

VIDEO DETAILS:
Title: "${title}"
${transcriptText ? `Transcript Summary:\n"""\n${transcriptText.substring(0, 5000)}\n"""` : "(No transcript available)"}

IN-VIDEO TRANSCRIPT SEGMENTS:
${segmentsText || "(No transcript segments available)"}

Instructions:
1. Generate exactly 5 post-video questions.
2. Generate exactly ${numInVideoQuestions} in-video questions.
3. For each in-video question, it MUST test the viewer's memory or understanding of the events/concepts discussed in its corresponding Segment.
4. Each question must have exactly 4 options.
5. Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object matching the format below. Do not include markdown code blocks, backticks, or any conversational text.
