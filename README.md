## 🌍 The Vision

Online learning suffers from low engagement and high distraction. **Kaevrix** solves this by injecting esports-inspired psychological pressure, RPG mechanics, and cognitive gameplay into standard educational content. 

**Learn. Compete. Ascend.** Knowledge becomes power, learning becomes combat, and skill becomes social status.

## ⚔️ The Core Loop: Duel Arena

The Duel Arena is the heart of Kaevrix. This is where players queue up, sync up, and face off in real-time learning battles.

### 1. Target Acquisition & Matchmaking
> Search for any educational topic directly within the platform. Once a target video is selected, the engine matchmakes you with an opponent entering the same knowledge domain.

### 2. Synchronized Watch Battles
> Both players are locked into a synchronized playback session. During the watch phase, players must maintain focus to earn tactical energy, deploy power-ups, and manage high-stakes risk/reward multipliers.

### 3. AI-Forged Quiz Phase

## 🛡️ RPG Progression & Meta-Game

Kaevrix isn't just match-by-match; it's a long-term progression ecosystem designed to build tactical identity and expertise.

### Classes & Skill Trees
Players define their legacy by choosing distinct combat subclasses (e.g., *The Speedrunner*, *The Edgelord*). Winning duels grants XP to unlock devastating abilities, passive combo enhancements, and rule-bending ultimate perks.

### 👑 Domain Bosses & Ascension
Elite players can conquer specific knowledge territories (e.g., the "JavaScript Arena"). Challengers must risk all their accumulated XP in cinematic Ascension Battles to dethrone the reigning Domain Boss and claim the territory.

## ⚡ Engineering Architecture

Kaevrix is built on a highly optimized, low-latency infrastructure to ensure competitive integrity.

* **Socket.IO State Machine:** Manages concurrent matchmaking, complex phase transitions (Lobby $\rightarrow$ Watch $\rightarrow$ Quiz $\rightarrow$ Results), and zero-latency chat.
* **Sync Drift Tolerance:** Custom logic to handle YouTube IFrame buffering, ensuring players remain perfectly synchronized regardless of network disparities.
* **Dynamic AI Prompts:** Seamless integration with Gemini API to fetch, parse, and deploy structured JSON quiz data within a strict 5-second pre-match countdown buffer.
* **Zero-Asset Audio Engine:** Real-time synthesis of sound effects via the browser's native Web Audio API, entirely eliminating massive `.wav`/`.mp3` bundle bloat.
